# Motion to Establish a Royal Commission on Northern Self-Governance

## This House recognises that;

 1. The people of the North of England have been repeatedly let down by successive governments in recent years
 2. That the North of England has been allowed to fall behind economically compared to the rest of England
 3. That the root cause of these failings stems from an out-of-touch unnecessarily centralised Wesminster system of governance

## This House, therefore, calls upon the government to;

 1. Form a royal commission to investigate the need for a system of self-government and devolution to parts of Northern England
 2. Establish a Secretary of State for The North tasked with overseeing the development of the North of England
 3. Commit to having a real, positive, and demonstratable impact on the lives of the people of Northern England

**This motion was written by the Honourable Antonio J. Linares, Member for Scotland.**
